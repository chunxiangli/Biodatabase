Biodatabase
===========

It contains the python scripts for the practice course of Biodatabase. It aims to study the SQL &amp; Ensembl biodatabase.

assignment1:
  According to a gene name, find the corresponding Ensembl Gene ID using SQL
  
assignment2:
  Find all the corresponding transcript and translation IDs for an Ensembl Gene ID
  
assignment3:
  Find the length of the gene with a given gene name
  
assignment4:
  Given in- put gene names, use SQL to query for the IDs of corresponding transcripts that
  also have a protein translation, read the corresponding entries from the FASTA file containing 
  all transcripts as cDNA, convert the cDNAs into protein sequences, do pair-wise local alignment 
  for each pair of proteins encoded by a different gene, and output the score of the best local alignment 
  for each pair of genes.

assignment5:
  Given a gene name, prints out the names of transcripts from this gene along with the number of exons for each transcript.
  
assignment6:
  Given a name of a marker, prints out the list of genes that overlap with the position of this marker.
  
assignment7:
  Given a gene name, find all GO terms associated with protein translations from this gene and prints out the list of GO terms.

assignment8:
  Given a set of gene names, read the upstream regions and print the results into a FASTA file with gene names as the headers and
  upstream sequences as the content. Then feed the output to a motif finder program and describe the results.
